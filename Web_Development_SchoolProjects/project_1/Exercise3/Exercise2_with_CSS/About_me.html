                <p class="bio_text">
                    I'm Nikos,a student in the department of informatics at Athens Univercity of Economics and Business.
                    After graduating from school,2nd lyceum in Alimos(southern department of Athens),it was time for me to 
                    decide what steps I'm going to take considering my career future.
                    Curious as to how this little machines can produce so much work,enough to make everyone depenting on them,
                    I decided to follow the path of computer science and since then I haven't looked back.It's been an amazing 
                    experience for me and each day I learn something new.My hunger for exploring every inch of this science may 
                    be the reason why I'm still not aware of what exactly should I focus on.Taking into consideration my likes 
                    and goals,a full stack developer job seems to suits me better but who knows what the future holds for me.
                    I guess we'll learn in process!
                    Take a better look of me by searching the rest of the stuff and feel free to contact me for more information.
                    I'm waiting..!<em>*typing nervously*</em>
